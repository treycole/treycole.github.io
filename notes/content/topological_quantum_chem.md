> __Question__: Topological insulators represent only a few hundred of the 200,000 stoichiometric compounds. Why? Is there a problem with the band description of materials? 

- Chemists and physicists use fundamentally different viewpoints on materials
	- physicists: momentum space
	- chemists: real space
- Unifying approach of real and reciprocal space is desired

### Approach

- Compile all possible ways energy bands in a solid can be connected in the BZ to obtain band structures in all non-magnetic space groups
	- Crystal symmetries place constraints on allowed connections
	- At high symmetry k-points, Bloch functions are classified by irreducible representations of the symmetry group of $\vec{k_i}$ which also determine the degeneracy
	- Away from these points, fewer constraints and degeneracies are lowered
	- E.g.  $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ approach allows computation of band structure near high-symmetry points, group theory places constraints on how they can be connected
	- Use graph theoretic problem of constructing multi-partite graphs
- Develop tools to compute way in which real space orbitals determine symmetry character of electronic bands
	- Given [[Wyckoff Positions]] + orbital symmetry (s, p, d etc.)
	- Find symmetry character of all bands throughout BZ 
	- Extend notion of band reps to materials with SOC and/or TRS
		- band reps consist of all energy bands + Bloch functions arising from localized orbitals respecting crystal symmetry (+ maybe TRS )
		- set of band reps $\subset$ set of groups of bands obtained from this new graph theory
	- Identify set of ==_elementary band reps_== (EBRs) corresponding to the smallest sets of bands that can be derived from [[wannier_functions|Wannier Functions]] (10,403 of them $\forall$ space groups, Wyckoff pos, and orbitals)
		- If the number of e-'s is fraction of number of connected bands ([[Connectivity]]) that form EBR, then system is symmetry enforced semi-metal ([[Semimetals]])
			- largest number of connected bands in EBR is 24, smallest fraction of filled bands in a semi-metal is 1/24
		- If number of connected bands is smaller than total number of bands in EBR, then momentum space description exists but Wannier one does not (topological)
			- Topological insulators are those materials with bands not in the list of elementary components but that are in the graph enumeration
### Graph Theory and band structure

Consider $D$ dimensional crystal invariant under the action of a space group with elements $\{ R | \vec{d}\ \} \in G$ where $R$ is a rotation or rotoinversion $\vec{d}$ is a translation such that $\{ R | \vec{d}\ \} \vec{x} = R\vec{x} + \vec{d}$ . The Bravais lattice of a space group is generated by a set of linearly independent translations $\{E|\vec{t}_i\}$ , $i=1, \cdots , D$ where $E$ is the identity. 

Each $\vec{k}$ in the BZ remains invariant up to translation by reciprocal lattice vector under action of symmetry elements in its little group $G_\vec{k} \subset G$.The Bloch wavefunctions $|u_{n\vec{k}}\rangle$ transform under a sum of irreps of $G_{\vec{k}}$ 
- Bands at high symmetry points will have non-accidental degeneracies equal to dimension of the representations
- Spinless and SOC absent systems have ordinary linear reps
- Systems with SOC have double-valued reps
