The idea was popularized by Sir Michael Berry in 1984.\nTo demonstrate the Berry phase, we consider some state in Hilbert space (e.g. the ground state) of some system parameterized by a continuously varying parameter (e.g magnetic field, nuclear coordinates etc.). We then vary the parameter in a closed path, such that the system returns to where it started.\nAdiabatic Approximation\nIf the parameters very ‚Äúslowly‚Äù with time, then energy eigenvalues should just follow the change in parameters. The eigenvectors will acquire an additional geometrical phase associated with the change in parameter.\nAssuming no degeneracy (so as to have constant ordering of states),the energy eigenstates are found from the time-independent Schrodinger equation\nH(t) |n; t\\rangle = E_n (t) |n; t\\rangle\nnoting that at any time t, the states and eigenvalues may change. The time-dependent Schrodinger equation for some arbitrary ket expanded in the energy eigenstates is\n\ti\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} |\\alpha; t \\rangle = H(t) |\\alpha; t \\rangle\nwhere\n|\\alpha; t \\rangle = \\sum_{n} c_n (t) e^{i \\theta_n(t)} |n; t \\rangle\nand \\theta(t) is the typical dynamical phase acquired by the energy eigenstates\n\t\\theta_n (t) = -\\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\int_0 ^t E_n(t&#039;) dt&#039;\nThrough a straightforward substitution into the TDSE, taking the time-derivative of the TDSE, acting from the left with an equal time eigenstate, and using orthogonality of equal time eigenstates, one arrives at a differential equation for the coefficients,\n\\dot{c}_m(t) = -c_m(t) \\langle m;t| \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}|m; t\\rangle - \\sum_{n} c_n(t) e^{i(\\theta_n - \\theta_m)} \\frac{\\langle m;t| \\dot{H} | n;t\\rangle}{E_n(t) - E_m(t)}\nThe second term shows mixing with other states due to the time dependence of the Hamiltonian. This result is exact. The adiabatic approximation amounts to neglecting the second term, meaning\n\\frac{\\langle m;t| \\dot{H} | n;t\\rangle}{E_n(t) - E_m(t)} \\equiv\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\ll \\langle m;t| \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}|m; t\\rangle \\approx \\frac{E_m}{\\hbar}\nThe solution for the coefficients is then\nDiscrete formulation\nConsider N vectors |u_0\\rangle to |u_{N-1}\\rangle that describe the ground state of a system at each discrete step in parameter space, where the last state |u_{N}\\rangle is identified with |u_{0}\\rangle. The Berry phase is defined as\n\\phi = -Im \\ ln[ \\langle u_0 | u_1 \\rangle\\langle u_1|u_2 \\rangle \\cdots\\langle u_{N-1}|u_0 \\rangle]\nThe reason for the imaginary natural log is that for some complex number z = |z| e^{i\\phi}, Im\\ ln z = \\phi , so we only retain the information about its phase. This definition chooses a branch of Im \\ ln\\ z such that -\\pi &lt; \\phi \\leq \\pi. The minus sign is conventional. This formulation has the benefit that it is gauge independent.\nParallel-Transport Gauge\nWe are free to choose any gauge we like for each of the |u_j\\rangle . We can define new gauges s.t. |\\bar{u}_0\\rangle = |u_0\\rangle , then choose the phase of |u_1\\rangle such that \\langle \\bar{u}_0 | \\bar{u}_1\\rangle is real and positive. If we propagate this down the line of states, then\n\\text{Im}\\ \\text{ln} \\langle \\bar{u}_j | \\bar{u}_{j+1}\\rangle = 0\nThis generates what is known as the parallel transport gauge. In this gauge choice,|\\bar{u}_0 \\rangle is no longer equivalent to  |\\bar{u}_N \\rangle, and they differ by exactly the Berry phase\n\\phi = \\text{Im}\\ \\text{ln} \\langle \\bar{u}_N | \\bar{u}_{0}\\rangle\nThe phase difference of the states are exactly zero until an abrupt discontinuity at the end of the loop.\nTwisted Parallel-Transport Gauge\nWe may like to have a choice of phase that is continuous throughout the evolution of the state."},"physics/index":{"slug":"physics/index","filePath":"physics/index.md","title":"Physics notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"physics/topological_obstructions":{"slug":"physics/topological_obstructions","filePath":"physics/topological_obstructions.md","title":"Topological Obstructions","links":["physics/topological_quantum_chem"],"tags":["Physics","Condensed-Matter","Topological-Materials"],"content":"Ref: Topological Quantum Chemistry\nWannier functions of a topologically trivial group of bands are smoothly continuous to an atomic limit, are exponentially localized, and transform under a band representation.\nIn a topological material, the Wannier functions for the valence (group of) bands either fail to be exponentially localized or break the crystal symmetry.

They effectively are related to a given Bloch energy eigenstate through a Fourier transform\n\\begin{align}\n|w_{n\\vec{R}}\\rangle &amp;= \\frac{V_{cell}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int_{BZ} e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{R}}\\ |\\psi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle d^3k \\\\\n|\\psi_{n, \\vec{k}} \\rangle &amp;= \\sum_{\\vec{R}}e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{R}}\\ |w_{n, \n\\vec{k}} \\rangle\n\\end{align}\nAs long as the Bloch eigenstates are a smooth function of \\vec{k}, then the Wannier representation decays rapidly with |\\vec{r} -\\vec{R}|  for some given \\vec{R} associated with the Wannier state.\nThe Fourier transform is a special case of a unitary transformation, so we can view the Bloch and Wannier functions as providing two different bases describing the same manifold of states associated with an energy band. Another way of saying this is that the projector onto band n is unitarily equivalent,\n\\mathcal{P}_n = \\frac{V_{cell}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int_{BZ} |\\psi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle\\langle \\psi_{n\\vec{k}}| d^3k = \\sum_{\\vec{R}} |w_{n\\vec{R}}\\rangle \\langle w_{n\\vec{k}}|\nMultiple Bands\nThe assumption that the Bloch eigenstates are smooth and periodic in \\vec{k} is based on the assumption that there are no degeneracies. However this is uncommon, there are typically degeneracies at high-symmetry points in the BZ. We can instead consider a group of J ordered bands that are separated by a finite energy gap from other bands. In insulators, the set of bands non-degenerate with the complementary set of bands will typically be the occupied band subspace. What we then seek is a set of J Wannier functions spanned by the J Bloch eigenstates constructed as,\n|w_{n,\\vec{R}}\\rangle = \\frac{V_{cell}}{(2\\pi)^3}\\int_{BZ}e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{R}}\n|\\tilde{\\psi}_{n, \\vec{k}}\\rangle\\  d^3k\nwhere the |\\tilde{\\psi}_{n, \\vec{k}}\\rangle are smooth functions of \\vec{k} everywhere in the BZ that are related to the true Bloch energy eigenstates via a unitary transform\n|\\tilde{\\psi}_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle = \\sum_{m=1}^{J}U_{mn}(\\vec{k})|\\psi_{m, \\vec{k}}\\rangle\nThe manifold of J \\times J unitary matrices U_{mn}(\\vec{k}) have been chosen to ‚Äúiron out‚Äù the non-analytic behavior near the degeneracies at high symmetry points. Then, the Wannier functions will be exponentially localized. The cell-periodic wavefunctions |u_{n,\\vec{k}}\\rangle transform in the same way as the Bloch eigenstates,\n|\\tilde{u}_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle = \\sum_{m=1}^{J} U_{mn}(\\vec{k}) |u_{m\\vec{k}}\\rangle\nThis is known as a multiband or non-Abelian gauge transformation. It is not obvious whether this procedure is always possible. It can always be accomplished in localized region around some \\vec{k_0}, where we choose a set |\\tilde{u}_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle of orthonormal functions spanning the band subspace of H_{\\vec{k_0}}, being either the eigenstates themselves or some unitary rotation of them. We then choose at each nearby \\vec{k} a unitary rotation on the energy eigenstates |u_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle  such that they are ‚Äúoptimally aligned‚Äù with |\\tilde{u}_{n\\vec{k_0}}\\rangle.\nOptimal Alignment\nGiven two sets of orthonormal sets of J  states |u_n\\rangle and |\\nu_n\\rangle, where the subspaces  \\mathcal{P}_u = \\sum |u_n\\rangle \\langle u_n | and \\mathcal{P}_{\\nu} = \\sum |\\nu_n\\rangle \\langle \\nu_n| spanned by these states are similar but not identical. We would like to rotate one set such that they are as similar to the other as possible in both phase and character.\nOptimal alignment occurs when\n\\tilde{M}_{mn} = \\langle u_m| \\tilde{v}_n \\rangle\nis as close to the unit matrix as possible. Initially, before the unitary rotation,\nM_{mn} = \\langle u_m | \\nu_n \\rangle\nWe then perform a SVD on M\nM = V\\Sigma W^{\\dagger}\nwhere V and W are J\\times J unitary matrices and \\Sigma_{mn} = s_n \\delta_{nm} is a diagonal matrix whose elements s_n \\in \\mathcal{R} \\gt 0 are called ‚Äúsingular values‚Äù. One can show that if we apply V to the set of states \\{ |u_n\\rangle \\} and W to the set of states \\{ |\\nu_n\\rangle \\} we get new states\n\\begin{align}\n|u&#039;_n \\rangle &amp;= \\sum_m V_{mn} |u_m\\rangle \\\\\n|\\nu&#039;_n \\rangle &amp;= \\sum_m W_{mn} |\\nu_m\\rangle\n\\end{align}\nthat are optimally aligned in the sense that\nM&#039; = \\langle u&#039;_m | \\nu&#039;_n \\rangle = s_n \\delta_{mn}\nThe extent to which s_n \\lt 1 is a measure of the difference between \\mathcal{P}_u and \\mathcal{P}_{\\nu}. Since we are given |u_n\\rangle and they shouldn‚Äôt be rotated, we apply V^{\\dagger} to both sets, returning |u&#039;_n \\rangle back to |u_n\\rangle and\n|\\tilde{\\nu}_n\\rangle = \\sum_m (WV^{\\dagger})_{mn} | \\nu_m \\rangle\nwhich are in optimal alignment with the initial |u_n\\rangle. We also can think about the procedure as constructing the best unitary approximation to M\n\\mathcal{M} = VW^{\\dagger}\nthat tells us how the states |u_n\\rangle got rotated in going to the |\\nu_n\\rangle. We then apply the h.c. to undo this rotation. If any of the s_n = 0 than there is a subspace of vectors in \\mathcal{P}_{\\nu} that are orthogonal to the space spanned by \\mathcal{P}_u so they can‚Äôt be aligned.\nProjection method\nThe procedure of optimal alignment works locally in k but whether there is always a way to do this globally is highly non-trivial. One way of practically constructing multiband Wannier functions is via the projection method.\n\nChoose a set of J localized ‚Äútrial functions‚Äù |t_n \\rangle whose locations and characters are similar to the expected Wannier functions\nExpand this set of functions to include periodic images |t_{n\\vec{R}}\\rangle and construct Bloch like functions |\\chi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle = \\sum_{\\vec{R}} e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{R}} |t_{n\\vec{R}}\\rangle that are smooth in \\vec{k}\nOrthonormalize them at each \\vec{k} via computing the overlap matrix S^{(\\vec{k})}_{mn} = \\langle \\chi_{m\\vec{k}} | \\chi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle and construct |\\chi&#039;_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle = \\sum_m (S_{\\vec{k}}^{-1/2})_{mn} |\\chi_{m \\vec{k}}\\rangle\nPerform J\\times J unitary rotation on the |\\psi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle so as to obtain |\\tilde{\\psi}_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle that are optimally aligned with the |\\chi&#039;_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle using the optimal alignment\nFor some choices of trial functions, |\\chi_{n\\vec{k}}\\rangle are not linearly independent and S_{\\vec{k}} becomes singular and the procedure fails. For ordinary insulators, the procedure can be fixed via a new choice of trial function. In certain kinds of topological insulators, there can be a topological obstruction; in this case a singularity in S_{\\vec{k}} is gauranteed to occur somewhere in the BZ.\n\nLocalization\nWannier interpolation"}}
